            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>One of the easiest and most widely used laguages is HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. Its used as the framework language for creating websites, it can be used to navigate the internet, or even in aiding the development and creation of video games</p>
            <p>But how does HTML work? HTML tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.</p>
